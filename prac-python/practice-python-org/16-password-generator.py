# Note: this is a 4-chili exercise, not because it introduces a concept, but because this exercise is more like a project. 
# Feel free to skip this and come back when youâ€™re more ready!

# Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 
# The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. 
# Include your run-time code in a main method.

# Extra:

#     Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.
